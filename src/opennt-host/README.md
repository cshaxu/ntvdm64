# opennt-host

Independently composable OpenNT host-capability components: host algorithms and
their smallest source-derived replacements where a historical host facility no
longer exists. It does not own BOP dispatch or Bochs machine mechanics.

It may use declared same-shaped interfaces from `adapter-win32` and
`adapter-softpc`; it must not access `bx-mantle` or `bx-core` directly.

## Local intrusion register

Every changed imported OpenNT component and every new source-derived host
component is recorded here with original source identity, exception identifier,
unavailable dependency, retained observable semantics and focused verification.
The future static library name is `opennt-host`; its public include surface is
the explicitly declared OpenNT host ABI consumed by `opennt-bop` and `app`.
