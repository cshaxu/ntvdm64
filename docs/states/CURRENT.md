# Project Status

## Current Work

The owner cancelled S6 Terminal handoff investigation because the symptom is
no longer reproducible. No repair is claimed. Temporary observer changes are
removed; [cancellation evidence](../etc/evidence/m0-t413-s6-terminal-handoff-investigation.md)
retains the bounded negative results. The published S5 products are unchanged.

**No active M/T/S packet.** M0 T413 S5 concludes the owner-approved five
NTVDMx64 exception-hook scope corrections. The
[closure audit](../history/m0-t413-accessor-restoration-closure.md#s5-exception-scope-closure)
and [S5 evidence](../etc/evidence/m0-t413-s5-exception-scope.md) retain scope,
provenance, tests and explicit compatibility limits. No next T is admitted.

## Current Technical Baseline

- O:\winnt contains fresh formal x86 /MT run16.exe, basesrv.exe and ntvdm.exe,
  original CCPU40, APP_VERSION 0.0.413 and protocol 3. Hashes match S5 evidence.
- Original vglob.c supplies all 38 getter/setter pairs through original typed
  declarations. The registered seven-line header seam retains original full
  vector layout; autonomous field rebinding and 20 conversion wrappers remain
  removed. Original complete USE16 IP arithmetic remains restored.
- Five c_xcptn.c scope corrections keep immediate continuation/flag cleanup
  inside the handled protected-mode hook branch. Unhandled and real-mode faults
  reach original delivery. No new runtime function, adapter or overlay.
- 27 actual-source exceptional-control cases pass; uncorrected source fails
  101 assertions. All 168 IP-expression cases and 12 real DOS instruction cases
  pass, including divide-by-zero guest-handler entry and saved fault-IP check.
- Full original C-VID owner-library fixture, 17 command cases, six ConPTY
  profiles, native resize contracts and five prefilled short-window EDIT runs
  pass. The latter include 20 post-EDIT MEM completions.
- Protected-mode tests prove repaired branch behavior and delivery arguments,
  not complete IDT/TSS or WOW/WRITE runtime compatibility. No such claim is made.
- Mirror diff distance is 437 versus pre-T413 506; overlay cohort stays 125
  lines. S5 adds only ten braces and five attribution comments across existing
  condition lines (+15/-5); no executable statement is added.
- Build roots: build/M0-T413/S5/formal and integration. Prior products remain
  recoverable under integration/prior-products; runtime logs only O:\winnt\logs.
  Owner Terminal/RDP visual acceptance remains separate.

## Next Work

[Queue](QUEUE.md) remains the sole ordering authority. The owner-requested
[footprint cleanup proposal](../proposals/proposal-mirror-overlay-footprint-cleanup-001.md)
is first, with five planned S packets and separate mirror-diff, overlay and
adapter-autonomous-code acceptance metrics. Existing candidates keep their
relative order behind it. This documentation delivery admits no numeric T.

## Recent M0 Closures

T413 S5 supersedes the previous real-mode divide timeout disposition, without
reopening T412 Broker or claiming full WRITE recovery. T411/T410/T409/T407/T406
retain their recorded scopes and limitations.

## Recent Governance

Owner-requested footprint planning (M0 Td, Ordinary Mode) adds one candidate
proposal at Queue head with five planned S packets. Scope is documentation only;
the current source/runtime baseline is unchanged. Acceptance requires separate
mirror, overlay and adapter-autonomous reductions, generated-code accounting
and an explicit relocation guard. Documentation governance, relative links and
diff checks pass; the delivery commit carries the proposal and ordering change.

S5 P2 delivers the source repair, upstream hunk evidence and separate queued
proposal in one reviewed commit. The current packet is closed without admitting
the next candidate; no document inventory or parallel status is introduced.
