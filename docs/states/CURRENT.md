# Project Status

## Current Work

**No active M/T/S packet.**

M0 T405 S3 and T405 closed by owner direction on 2026-09-12:
static audit completed; restoration and verification transferred to approved
candidates, not declared implemented. See the
[closure and receiver table](../history/m0-t405-source-diff-audit.md).
The [original proposal](../history/m0-t405-source-diff-audit-proposal.md) and
[combined audit](../etc/evidence/opennt-replacement-audit-20260912.md) remain
preserved. No candidate is active; next admission is controlled here.

## Current Technical Baseline

- Sole product: Win32/x86 ntvdm32.exe with original CCPU40; native x64 and
  CPU30 are not product/build/acceptance targets.
- Audited source: 3d127962c82133cb6adad50f52733250bac5f11a, including
  unaccepted 1daff0ace WIP. T405 changed no product behavior and proves no new
  WRITE execution. [T404 closure](../history/m0-t404-owner-directed-closure.md)
  preserves prior runtime limitations.
- Latest existing deployed executable: O:\ntvdm64\ntvdm32.exe,
  2026-09-12 09:15, 3,232,768 bytes; SHA-256
  27F8D7B5BB074838E9484877954A38DCBCFA0BE64282A4A2D05C776867655107.
  This closure builds, runs and deploys no executable.
- [Queue](QUEUE.md) owns candidate order and pending repairs; [debt](TODO.md)
  retains full WRITE limitations. Ignored builds and runtime logs are preserved,
  not deleted to obtain Git cleanliness. Commit/push and status verification
  follow the closure record; an unavailable push remains pending delivery.

## Recent M0 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T405 | Static diff/overlay audit complete; 37 overlap rows and eight unresolved families transferred to candidate owners. No restoration/runtime acceptance claim. |
| T404 | Owner-directed closure with unaccepted WIP preserved; mouse acceptance retained, WRITE incomplete. |
| T403 | x64 mapping/overlay residue retired; formal x86 build and owner test passed. |

## Recent Governance

- **M0 Td S10 P1:** 8f7f6ec3d assigned U03-U08 owners and acceptance in existing proposals; pushed.
- **M0 Td S9 P1:** de5c4f969 placed physical mapping first and CCPU40 event recovery before broker.
- **M0 Td S8 P1:** recorded DPMI/XMS memory and transition restoration.
- **M0 Td S7 P1:** consolidated RTL, Console and WOW restoration with broker-before-WOW sequencing.

## Historical Status Ledger

The pre-compaction ledger remains in the
[archived status snapshot](../../artifacts/documentation-archive/20260910/etc/evidence/status-ledgers/status-ledger-snapshot-20260910.md).
It is historical evidence, not current authority. Closed-task detail belongs
in history; candidate plans remain in their linked proposals.
