# WOW32 — Fonts, text and metafiles

## Objective and admission

Owner-directed split dated 2026-09-28. This is one unnumbered candidate T in
[Queue](../states/QUEUE.md), not an active task or an implementation approval.
It owns workstream **W08**, formerly successor S8 / T422 S10, under the
[WOW32 program](proposal-wow32-production-completion-002.md). Its S identifiers
below are local to this candidate; historical S references resolve through the
program transfer table. Existing code, stable capability IDs, tests and failures
are inherited rather than reset. No new global source audit is required.

## Complete scope and dependencies

Inherited: font/text conversion and drawing, font lifetime, metafile creation/playback/release and failure paths; consume W07 identities.

Expected reuse boundaries: [Files, directories, environment and OEM](proposal-wow32-files-environment-oem-001.md), [GDI identity, DC and drawing](proposal-wow32-gdi-dc-drawing-001.md).
Queue order is the planned execution order; it does not assert an unproved
runtime dependency. At admission, prove which listed reuse edges are actual
prerequisites; do not require an unrelated service merely because it is listed. A missing
original-owner dependency receives an explicit bounded promotion; do not build
a temporary provider or silently absorb another candidate's implementation.
Necessary error and fatal-cleanup paths belong to the earliest consuming owner,
with stable-ID handoff, even when general hard-error recovery is later.

## Proposed S tasks

| S | Scope | Work | Required closure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | Text and metafile surface | Reconcile selected font/text conversions, font lifetimes and metafile operations. | Every selected family has production content and failure assertions. |
| S2 | Fonts and text | Complete conversion, font selection/loading/release and actual text drawing. | Guest text content and lifetime pass with OEM and GDI owners reused. |
| S3 | Metafiles | Complete creation, playback, conversion, release and partial-failure cleanup. | Recorded/playback content and error paths execute through original guest callers. |
| S4 | Package acceptance | Verify repeated drawing/release and retained application frontiers. | Font/text/metafile rows close without duplicate GDI identities or conversion providers. |

## Verification, boundaries and handoff

The program's [architecture and immutable-input rules](proposal-wow32-production-completion-002.md#architecture-and-immutable-inputs),
[executable-test requirements](proposal-wow32-production-completion-002.md#mandatory-executable-tests-for-each-implementation-s),
[production regression and publication gates](proposal-wow32-production-completion-002.md#every-production-code-p-regression-and-owner-side-testing)
and [inherited evidence](proposal-wow32-production-completion-002.md#inherited-research-code-and-evidence)
apply in full to this candidate. Build the selected MSVC Win32/x86 /MT CCPU40
production path. Preserve immutable guest media, one original owner per
mechanism, modern USER transport and the prohibition on a second scheduler.

Check in tests for every owned row: exact callers, inputs, assertions, normal
behavior, failures, reentry/asynchrony where relevant and resource/task cleanup.
Real guest/native interactions and content are required where available;
compile, symbol, process-exit or mock-only results are insufficient. Explicit
unavailable external or approved original-guest limitations stay non-pass.
Each production-code delivery retains DOS17, independent WRITE/WINMINE/SOL
frontiers and all applicable accepted package regressions; use the current
complete package and verify its hashes. No progress in one app offsets another's
regression. C11/C12 apply locally, not only at final program acceptance.

Close only this candidate's complete owner scope, with exact artifacts, test
entrypoints, remaining approved limitations and stable handoff IDs for consumers.
Do not defer unfinished implementation, errors or cleanup to integrated acceptance.
This planning split itself modifies no runtime, admits no active packet and
requires no commit or publication; the owner requested working-tree edits only.
