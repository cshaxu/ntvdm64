# Original-owner replacement audit, initial pass

## Question and method

Which selected COMMAND/EDIT host providers replace existing OpenNT behavior?
Read-only source and build-generator inspection on 2026-09-12, against HEAD
`05f3859da` plus retained WIP. Inspected `base_vdm_local.c`,
`base_vdm_client.c`, `console_compat.c`, `demfastio.c`, mirrored `srvvdm.c`,
and external OpenNT `windows/core/ntcon/server/private.c`. Source research
follows the project source policy. No build, guest run or product change.

## Rechecked initial findings

| Functional unit | Current owner | Original owner | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Next-command service | adapter BaseSrv `get_next_command` | `base/win32/server/srvvdm.c:BaseSrvGetNextVDMCommand` | Rehosted queue/ownership/wait/capacity policy; recover original service slice before deleting replacement. CSR transport is a separate excluded dependency. |
| PIF response | adapter BaseSrv `fill_pif_info` | `srvvdm.c:BaseSrvFillPifInfo` | Rehosted response policy, not merely transport; compare field and failure order. |
| First-VDM state | adapter BaseSrv `base_vdm_local_is_first` | `srvvdm.c:BaseSrvIsFirstVDM` | Original global policy replaced by session state; explicitly resolve cardinality before migration. |
| Current directories (set/get grouped) | adapter BaseSrv directory storage | `srvvdm.c:BaseSrvSetVDMCurDirs/BaseSrvGetVDMCurDirs` | Recover original ownership and consumption rules through bounded storage binding. |
| DOS task exit | adapter BaseSrv exit | `srvvdm.c:BaseSrvExitDOSTask` | Original teardown policy partly replaced; enumerate unavailable console/CSR lifecycle operations. |
| Fast read | mirror overlay `dos/dem/demfastio.c` | `base/ntos/vdm/x86/rdwr.c:NTFastDOSIO` | New user-mode seek/read/guest-copy route. Compare finite original slice and original carry/fallback path; not proven corrupting writer. |
| Cursor visibility | Win32 adapter `ShowConsoleCursor` | `windows/core/ntcon/server/private.c:SrvShowConsoleCursor` | Confirmed unequal contract: original mouse-pointer display count versus current text-cursor visibility and fixed 0/-1 result. Not proof of prior false clicks. |

The generator `tools/build/New-T310OriginalSoftpcNinja.ps1` explicitly selects
the BaseSrv adapters, `console_compat.c` and the fast-I/O overlay. Mirror
presence alone does not prove an original function enters the product link.
These seven grouped findings are not seven proved removable implementations:
some contain essential unavailable-interface bindings. No safe deletion-line
total has been established.

## Additional scope, not included in the seven

- `base_vdm_client.c:GetNextVDMCommand` also implements capture/wait/retry;
  compare original `base/win32/client/vdm.c`, not just server routines.
- `ReadConsoleInputExW` filters Alt+Enter key-down but not key-up, and its
  NOREMOVE branch bypasses that filter. This is policy beyond API forwarding;
  compare the original input contract before judging intentional asymmetry.
- CPU40 descriptor transitions, BOP/interrupt return, keyboard, mouse,
  text video, memory and environment services remain incomplete audit areas.
  Include mirror-internal special cases and diagnostics, not just adapters.
- Architecture/source policy now places external kernel VDM in `opennt-host`,
  but `docs/design/CODING.md` and `docs/rules/CODING.md` still retain older
  kernel-vdm placement text. Record this governance inconsistency; no source
  move is justified solely by the directory label.

## Required completion

For every selected functional unit, record original path/function, current
provider, actual build selection, unavailable outgoing interface, semantic
differences, retain/replace/delete decision and regression workload. Count
functional units separately from files and physical added/deleted lines.
Compare selected upstream against both mirror and overlay; do not label all
adapter lines hacks. This initial pass is not a full COMMAND/EDIT closure
audit and supplies no whole-project total.
