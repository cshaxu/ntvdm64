# T420 S37 OEMUNI capability review

## Scope and baseline

S37 follows S36 closure 5ad0ac874. The original manifest selects file.c and
process.c; toemuni.c is the original test, not a production unit. S17 recovered
those sources and DIV-269 early-failure sentinels. This review must establish
actual non-ASCII guest paths, buffer/failure contracts and reached consumers,
not infer capability from source inclusion. Current product is x86 CCPU40;
original guest media remain immutable.

## Initial owner inventory

The two translation units define 29 Oem entry points. A textual call search
finds DEM/COMMAND consumers for file creation/deletion/attributes/rename,
FCB enumeration, full-path/current-directory operations, directory creation
and removal, drive/disk/volume/computer information, search/short paths and
environment conversion. ExpandEnvironmentStringsOem is reached textually
from original nt_pif.c. Additional WOW consumers are present in wdos.c,
wkfileio.c and wkman.c; their presence is not evidence of a working Win16
workload. MoveFileExOem and GetTempFileNameOem have only WOW textual consumers
in this initial search.

GetSystemDirectoryOem, GetWindowsDirectoryOem, GetTempPathOem and
CreateProcessOem have no direct call-shaped matches outside their definitions
and original test in the scanned source roots. This is a preliminary inventory,
not proof of unreachability: macro aliases, formal selection and remaining
roots must be reconciled before final disposition.

## Non-ASCII and buffer baseline

The expanded existing oemuni_failure_fixture builds original file.c and
process.c against the same formal RTL/support inputs as the product. Build:
`node tools/build/Generate-T420S17OemUniNinja.mjs .
build/M0-T420/S37/oem-contract-r1
build/M0-T420/S36/original-callback-product-r1`, followed by MSVC x86 Ninja
target oemuni-failure-fixture.exe. The reused formal inputs are those of the
S36 deployed baseline; no product source or guest input is changed.

The executable reports OEM=437 and ANSI=1252, then exits zero with:

- S37_OEM_FULLPATH_NONASCII_PART_SHORT_BUFFER_OK: non-ASCII e-acute OEM
  filename, full path checked against Windows Unicode conversion, correct
  file-part pointer/text, and one-byte buffer returns required size without
  overwriting its sentinel.
- S37_OEM_ENV_NONASCII_DELETE_MISSING_OK: Unicode-set environment value is
  retrieved through OEM conversion, removed through the original OEM entry,
  and returns ERROR_ENVVAR_NOT_FOUND afterward.

The previous null-short-path and valid file-part checks also pass. All
environment changes are process-local. This proves the current SBCS host
contract only; no DBCS, real DOS file operation, process creation or full-package
closure is claimed. Those remaining selected-family checks continue in S37.
